1️⃣ Problem Statement

Brain tumors are life-threatening and require early and accurate detection for effective treatment. Analyzing MRI scans manually is:

⚠️ Time-consuming

⚠️ Requires expert radiologists

⚠️ Prone to human error

This project solves that by developing an AI-powered tumor detection system using YOLOv12, enabling fast, reliable detection of tumor regions from MRI images. The goal is to build a simple, accessible, and high-accuracy tool for educational and research use.

2️⃣ Scope of the Project

This project covers:

🎯 Training YOLOv12 on MRI brain scan datasets

🎯 Detecting tumor regions using bounding boxes

🎯 Providing a ready-to-use weight file (best.pt)

🎯 A clean inference notebook for easy testing

🎯 Sample images for quick demo

🎯 Modular code that can be extended to Multi-class tumor detection




Segmentation models

Real-time detection

Web or mobile deployment

🚫 Out of scope (for now):

Medical-grade diagnosis

3D volumetric MRI scans

Pixel-wise segmentation masks

3️⃣ Target Users

This project is ideal for:

👨‍🎓 Students learning AI / ML / deep learning

🧑‍🔬 Researchers in medical imaging
