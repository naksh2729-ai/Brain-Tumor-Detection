## Project Title: Student Wellness Assistant

## Problem Statement
College students often struggle with managing their daily routines, especially during exam seasons or busy weeks. Sleep schedules become irregular, study hours vary a lot, stress increases without warning, and tasks pile up unnoticed. Most students don’t track their habits, which makes it harder to understand what’s affecting their productivity or overall well-being. The problem is that there is no simple tool that helps a student monitor their routine and also manage academic deadlines in one place.
The Student Wellness Assistant aims to solve this by offering a small, easy-to-use system that records daily habits, organizes tasks, and gives basic insights to prevent burnout.

## Scope of the Project
The project focuses on three main areas:

• **Daily Routine Tracking:**
  Students can record sleep hours, study hours, mood rating, steps/activity, and notes.

• **Task Management:**
  Users can add assignments, exams, personal tasks, deadlines, and importance levels.

• **Wellness Analysis & Recommendations:**
  The system calculates weekly averages, predicts burnout levels, and lists urgent tasks.

The scope is limited to a console-based Python program that uses CSV files for storage. It is designed to stay simple while still being useful in day-to-day student life. The project does not include a GUI or machine learning model yet, but it can be extended later.

## Target Users
